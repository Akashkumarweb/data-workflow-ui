# SmartPrep UI – Interactive Data Workflow Tool

SmartPrep UI is a modern, **React + Vite** application that empowers users to upload, transform, and visualize CSV data—no code required. Designed with scalability, clarity, and user experience in mind, this project demonstrates my expertise in advanced frontend architecture, reusable component patterns, and the latest in UI tooling.
